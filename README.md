# SAGE - FRED on CPG 

## What is SAGE?
FRED is an open source web application that enables users to edit JSON [FHIR resources](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/resourcelist.html) and [FHIR bundles](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/bundle.html). Built as an HTML5 app, FRED runs entirely within your web browser - no data is sent to a server. *Note - the project is currently under active development. Code is rough, there are bugs and features may change or be removed!*
SAGE expands this to work with CPGs (Clinical Practice Guideline), allowing users to create and edit JSON CPG resources as specified under FHIR. 

## Try it with...

#### DSTU2:
- [A Patient Resource](http://docs.smarthealthit.org/fred/?resource=.%2Fsamples%2Flisa.json)
- [A Blood Pressure Resource](http://docs.smarthealthit.org/fred/?resource=.%2Fsamples%2Fbp.json)
- [A Bundle of Observations](http://docs.smarthealthit.org/fred/?resource=.%2Fsamples%2Fbundle.json)
- [Any FHIR Resource](http://docs.smarthealthit.org/fred/)

#### STU3:
- [A Patient Resource](http://docs.smarthealthit.org/fred/?profiles=.%2Fprofiles%2Fstu3.json&resource=.%2Fsamples%2Fstu3-patient.json)
- [A Bundle of Observations](http://docs.smarthealthit.org/fred/?profiles=.%2Fprofiles%2Fstu3.json&resource=.%2Fsamples%2Fstu3-bp-bundle.json)
- [Any FHIR Resource](http://docs.smarthealthit.org/fred/?profiles=.%2Fprofiles%2Fstu3.json)

#### R4 support added (Thank you! @WolfByttner)

## Current features and changes
- Mandatory fields are automatically loaded in when creating a resource
- Values that must come from a fixed set are selectable from dropdowns
- Fields with fixed values have been prefilled
- CPG resources have been added

## Planned features
Please see [roadmap.md](roadmap.md)

## API
| Url Parameter | Value | Action |
| ------------- | ----- | ------ |
| resource | Escaped url for FHIR resource on CORS enabled server (including open FHIR servers) | Launches with resource open. |
| profiles | Escaped url for summarized FHIR profiles (see building resource profiles below) on a CORS enabled server. Included are ```/profiles/dstu2.json``` (DSTU2) and ```/profiles/connect12.json``` (May 2016 connectathon) | Configures FRED to support for a particular version of FHIR.|
| remote | 0 or 1 | Supports controlling FRED from another web application (using postMessage) when set to ```1``` ([demo](http://docs.smarthealthit.org/fred/messaging-demo.html)). |
| warn | 0 or 1 | If set to ```0```, will suppress a warning when navigating away from the page. Useful when developing with auto-reloading. |

## Building Resource Profiles
To reduce load time, FRED uses a simplified copy of the (>15mb!) JSON FHIR resource profiles. To convert the FHIR resource profiles into this format, ensure the desired profile bundles and valueset bundles are in the fhir_profiles subdirectory and run ```npm run build-profiles```

## About
FRED is a project of [SMART Health IT](http://smarthealthit.org), a joint effort of the not-for-profit institutions, Boston Childrenâ€™s Hospital Computational Health Informatics Program and the Harvard Medical School Department for Biomedical Informatics.
